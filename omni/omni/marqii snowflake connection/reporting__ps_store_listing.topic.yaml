ai_context: Use this topic to analyze store listing configurations against
  account licenses to identify mismatches, compliance issues, or optimization
  opportunities. Compare active features on store listings with purchased
  licenses to find stores with access enabled but no corresponding license, or
  licensed features that aren't being utilized. Analyze license utilization
  rates across accounts and stores. Use ps_store_listing as the primary view for
  store-level analysis, ps_account for account-level grouping,
  ps_reporting_account_licenses to check purchased licenses,
  ps_reporting_combined for comprehensive cross-referencing, and ps_yext_package
  to understand package-level entitlements. Filter by license status fields to
  find active/inactive licenses, and join store listing access flags with
  license tables to detect discrepancies.
